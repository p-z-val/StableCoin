Decentralized Stablecoin
An Ethereum-based stablecoin protocol that maintains price parity with the US dollar via overcollateralization and decentralized governance. Users deposit collateral assets like wBTC and wETH into smart contracts to mint new stablecoins called DSC.

The DSC supply and collateralization ratio is algorithmically managed by the DSCEngine contract based on price feeds. Users must maintain a minimum 200% collateral ratio or face liquidation. MKR-like governance allows adjusting of risk parameters.

Built to explore constructing stablecoins with transparent collateral-backing and no centralized oversight. Demonstrates Ethereum's capabilities for decentralized monetary policies and algorithmic management.

Developed core smart contract logic for collateralization, minting/burning, liquidations, and governance. Implemented Chainlink price feeds, solidity best practices, and comprehensive test suites.
